Daggerheart Character Creator

This repository contains a complete implementation of a Daggerheart
character creator and random generator. The code has been built from
the official Daggerheart System Reference Document (SRD), character
creation handouts and domain card reference. It adheres to the
canonical character creation and leveling rules and
includes a full database of all 188 domain cards extracted from
the SRD.

Contents

daggerheart_character_creator.py – Python module that exposes
everything needed to build or randomly generate a character.

domain_cards.json – JSON file containing the complete domain
card compendium used by the generator.

README.md – This file with setup and usage instructions.

Installation

Clone or copy this repository into your project directory.

Ensure that Python 3.8+ is installed. The code has no external
dependencies beyond the standard library.

The domain_cards.json file must reside in the same directory
as daggerheart_character_creator.py so that it can be loaded at
runtime. This JSON file was generated by parsing the official
Daggerheart Domain Cards PDF and contains names, levels, types,
recall costs and descriptions for every card.

Using the generator

Import the create_character function from
daggerheart_character_creator and call it with a target level (1–10)
and an archetype string. The archetype determines the overall style
of the character (Tank, Damage, Sneaky, Support, Healer, Face or
Control) and influences class selection, trait assignment, equipment
choice and domain card prioritisation.

from daggerheart_character_creator import create_character

# Generate a level 7 Sneaky character
character = create_character(level=7, archetype='Sneaky')
print(character.describe())


If you wish to specify the class and subclass rather than letting the
archetype algorithm decide, supply the class_name and
subclass_name keyword arguments. For example:

character = create_character(level=5, archetype='Face', class_name='Bard', subclass_name='Wordsmith')


The returned Character instance contains the complete character
sheet as well as a history of level‑up advancements. Calling
character.describe() yields a concise summary including class,
subclass, heritage, trait modifiers, hit points, evasion, starting
equipment, experiences and the domain cards gained at each level.

How it works

The generator follows the SRD’s four‑step level‑up procedure:

Tier achievements – At levels 2, 5 and 8 the character gains a
new experience and permanently increases their proficiency.

Advancements – At every level the character selects two
advancements from a list. Options include increasing traits,
adding hit point or stress slots, gaining new experiences,
improving evasion or acquiring an extra domain card. The
generator chooses based on the archetype: e.g. tanks favour HP and
evasion while damage dealers prioritise trait increases.

Damage thresholds – Damage thresholds increase each level. To
reflect this the generator adds one hit point at every level.

Domain card acquisition – At each level the character gains a
new domain card from one of their class domains. A simple
keyword‑matching algorithm scores card descriptions and picks
those that best match the archetype (e.g. healers pick cards
containing “heal” or “restore”).

Subclass specialisations and masteries are automatically taken at
levels 5 and 8. Should the character reach level 5 they receive
their subclass’s specialisation; at level 8 they gain mastery. All
choices respect the character’s class and domains.

Integrating into your project

To plug this generator into your own codebase:

Copy daggerheart_character_creator.py and domain_cards.json into
the desired folder (for example, a daggerheart subpackage).

Import create_character and call it where you need to create NPCs
or pre‑generated characters.

Extend or customise the data dictionaries at the bottom of
daggerheart_character_creator.py if you introduce new content
(additional ancestries, communities, subclasses, or equipment). By
design all data is plain Python and easy to edit.

Optionally use the Character data class to serialize or render
character sheets in your user interface.

Contributing

The generator was built from the official SRD and creation guides.
Wherever possible the code references the source material with
citations so that you can cross check the rules. If you
discover errata or wish to improve the build heuristics (for
instance, by introducing curated domain card paths per class and
archetype), please open a pull request or modify the data tables.
